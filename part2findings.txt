Part 2 Findings - Responders vs Non-Responders

Looking at the means generated from part2_analysis.py:

b_cell_pct: 
- responders: 29.2%
- non-responders: 26.3%
- small difference

cd8_t_cell_pct:
- responders: 20.5% 
- non-responders: 20.7%
- almost the same

cd4_t_cell_pct:
- responders: 36.3%
- non-responders: 26.3%
- big difference, responders have more cd4 t cells

nk_cell_pct:
- responders: 6.0%
- non-responders: 6.0% 
- same

monocyte_pct:
- responders: 8.0%
- non-responders: 22.7%
- big difference, non-responders have way more monocytes

Conclusion:
CD4 T cells and monocytes look most different between groups.
Responders have more CD4 T cells, non-responders have more monocytes.
